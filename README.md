# MAP

➡️Project done during an entire semester for the Advanced Programming Methods course.

➡️The project represents an interpreter for a small programming language, where all basic components were included : types, expressions, values, statements.

➡️Involved Java + JavaFX(for GUI)

➡️OOP concepts used, heavy use of interfaces and abstract classes for code reusability; ADT's implemented based on their Java interface also.

➡️Tables used for static memory allocation(symbolTable) and for dynamic memory allocation(heap table)

➡️Concurreny using threads(Executor) was involved

➡️For the final exam, my task was to implement a synchronizing mechanism for the already existing application, to be more specific a CountDownLatch.
